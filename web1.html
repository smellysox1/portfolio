    <h1> hi! i am jasper</h1>
    <h2> i am 11 years old but i am quite physically small.</h2>
    <p>my favorite video game is minecraft,of which i have modified a few times, but my favorite board game is catan.</p>
    <p> i like coding and reading as i can escape the real world to a better place. i have blephoritis which is a condition which makes me physically impossible to cry. because of this, i take eye drops every week to keep my eyes from becoming dry.</p> 
    <p> i have no sense of smell, and i have had a MRI and a camera up my nose. </p>
